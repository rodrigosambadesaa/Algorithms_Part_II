# Algorithms_Part_II
Code for programming assignments in Algorithms part 2 by Princeton.  
All the material for the course is free and available online at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/). It is best done as a progression to Algorithms Part 1 on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2/home/welcome)   
This course is significantly difficult than ALgorithms Part 1. It covers topics related to graphs, trees and tries in depth.  
The course consists of 5 programming assignments, each targetting a specific data structure or algorithm and it's real world application. To complete an assignment you require a score above 80% on automated tests.

## Week 1: [Wordnet](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/wordnet.html)
Using Digraphs and Traversal algorithms to compute ancestors in Digraphs.  
_Completed:_ 93%  
_Features to implement:_  
* Timing and memory related issues when finding Shortest Ancestral Path

## Week 2: [Seam](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/seam.html)
Using Djikstra's algorithm to enable dynamic and content aware resizing of images.  
_Completed:_ 81%  
_Features to implement:_  
* Failing to find least energy seam for large images like chameleon.png, despite working for smaller images

## Week 3: [Baseball](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/baseball.html)
Applying Maxflow-Mincut properties to eliminate teams in a Baseball tournament. Uses Flowgraph and Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.  
_Completed:_ 95%  
_Features to implement:_  
* Failing to clear memory constraint for large test case
* Apply check for illegal arguments

## Week 4: [Boggle](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/boggle.html)
Using suffix tries and traversal algorithms to find all valid words in a boggle board.  
_Completed:_  98%  
_Features to implement:_   
* Fails last timing test.  

## Week 5: [Burrows](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/burrows.html)
Implementing MoveToFront and CircularSuffixArray for Burrows-Wheeler Transform.  
_Completed:_  86%  
_Features to implement:_  
* Fails to inverseTransform a compressed message.  

## Comment:  
It is increasingly difficult and requires a lot of time. I had to read the assignments many times to understand the question. Seam and BUrrows were challenging to implement. I enjoyed Boggle and Wordnet the most. Boggle specially because it is a game we have all played and algorithms provides a solution to it. Also it uses tries which is a very intuitive data structure.
